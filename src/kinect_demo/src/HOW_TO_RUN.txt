1. Make a directory called catkin_ws_testtag, clone this repo into that directory.
2. Move the files out of the FRI Tag folder directly into catkin_ws_testtag. Delete the FRI-Tag folder.
3. Check to make sure client.c has the correct IP address.
4. Delete anything in caughtmessage.txt.
5. Compile server.c. Put the executable into the catkin_ws_testtag folder, and run it on the runner bot.
6. rosrun the runner on the runner bot; rosrun the chaser on the chaser bot
